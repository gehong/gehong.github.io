      <h1>Gene Hong</h1>
      <p>I lived in Seoul, Korea.</p>
      <p>I moved to Syracuse.</p>
      <p>I now live in New York.</p>
      <p>I enjoy playing video games with my friends.</p>
      <p>I watch a lot movies and often discuss about them with my sister.</p>
      <p>I have a beautiful girlfriend and a lovely family who care about me.</p>
      <p>I like both cats and dogs, although I like watching cat pictures more.</p>
      <p>I try to stay away from social media, even though I have <a href = "https://www.facebook.com"> my own page.</a></p>
      <p>I was a drill sergeant in 55th Division of Korea Army for 2 years.</p>
      <p>I am not anymore, but it was a good experience and also a good memory that I still cherish.</p>
      <p>I am now majoring in Biotechnology in Syracuse University in hope of becoming a doctor in the future.</p>
      <p>I know it will be an arduous process of learning and mastering my academic skill, but in the end, I know I will prevail.</p>
